video_game Just developed a 2D chess-game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! (Only for desktop)

Instructions:

The chessboard is designed using HTML and CSS, providing a clean and visually pleasing interface. The board highlights valid moves when a player selects a piece.

Players can easily move their pieces using the drag-and-drop functionality. Clicking and holding a piece with the mouse can be dragged to the desired square on the board. Upon release, the piece will be placed on the new square.
